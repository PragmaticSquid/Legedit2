Some notes on creating frame-break or pop-out effect cards.

(Note: I'm using MacOS Preview for these steps when image manipulation
is involved.)

1. Crop and adjust the original image to a usable zoom level - such
   that the zoom is 1.0 in legedit.  I've found it helpful to make the
   resulting image the legedit output of 750x1050.

2. Create the background layer using the frbreak_hero_common or
   frbreak_hero_uncommon Hero template
   * select the powers
   * blank the name, title, cost, recruit, attack

3. Export the frbreak_hero_* as the background layer

4. Copy the foreground from the original image and paste into the
   background layer image

5. In Legedit2, use the hero_common_frbreak or hero_uncommon_frbreak
   Hero template to overlay the name, title, cost, recruit, attack,
   text to the composite image to complete the card
