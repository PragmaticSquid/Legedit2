Some notes on creating frame break cards.

* Crop and adjust the original image to 750x1050 (I use MACOS Preview for this)
* Create the background layer using the hero_common_break1 Hero template
  * select the powers
  * blank name, title, cost, recruit, attack
* write out the hero_common_break1 as the background layer
* Copy the foreground from the original image and paste into the background layer image
* back into legedit and use the hero_common_break2 Hero template to complete the card
